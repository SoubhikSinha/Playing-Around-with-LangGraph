# Playing Around with `LangGraph	`

This repo contains Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate implementations of AI agent workflows, where LangGraphChatBots.ipynb shows how to design and experiment with conversational chatbots using LangGraph and MultiAIAgent.ipynb highlights building and coordinating multiple AI agents to perform tasks collaboratively, making the repository a practical guide for experimenting with agentic AI concepts, workflow orchestration, and chatbot development, thanks to [Krish Naik](https://github.com/krishnaik06).
